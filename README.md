# FilmSoc Start App
A small HTMl programme I wrote in 2018 to use at University of Surrey FilmSoc events to display the details of the film showing and signal to the audience when the film is about to start.
The application is a handful of lines of HTML and displays a jpg containing the FilmSoc logo, film name (in this case BlacKkKlansman), film director (Spike Lee), and release year (2018). It also features media controls for a text to speech audio file telling people to sit down and turn off their phones. 

The webpage is not currently actively hosted anywhere at present, but I may, in due course, clean the code and associated files for altering the image and text (these should really be replaced with text fields on the webpage and the image as the background, but when I wrote this programme initially, editing the photo was quicker than polishing the HTML with CSS and JavaScript), before hosting the webpage as part of my personal website.
